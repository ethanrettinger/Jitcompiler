All software packages written under the MCBS License must be distributed

All copies of this software redistributed under this License (Including any and
all modifications to the software) must be distributed under the same License
terms as the original software.

Any and all copies of this software must be distributed explicity mentioning
the original author of the software, and the date of the original release of
the software.

Software written under the MCBS License, or any modifications to software, or
any software that uses software written under the MCBS License, as well as
the MCBS License itself, may not be used by any for-profit entity for any
purpose whatsoever, as the authors of this License declare that for-profit
entities are not Memory Chad Blazing Safe, and are profiting from the work
of open-source developers.

No software written under the MCBS License may be used in any way that
violates the rights of any person, including but not limited to the right
to privacy, the right to freedom of speech, etc.

All projects written with the MCBS License must be **FREE** and **OPEN-SOURCE**.
This means that all source code must be available to the public, and all
users of the software must be able to modify the software to their liking,
and redistribute the software under the same License terms as the original
software. This also means that all software written under the MCBS License
must be distributed under the same License terms as the original software.

Any and all redistributions of software written under the MCBS License must
not be profitting from the work of the original authors of the software.

Binary distributions of software written under the MCBS License must be
available to the public, and must be free to download and use.

No projects written under the MCBS License may be, in any way, obfuscated,
minified, or otherwise made unreadable to the public. All aspects and facets
of the original source code shall be available, accessible and readable to
the public.

Any and all software redistributions of software written under the MCBS
License must fully accredit the original authors of the software, and must
not claim that the software is their own work. The intellectual property

Any and all software containing any programming language that is not explicitly

meaning that the software must be compiled with the highest optimization

authors of the MCBS License declare that any software that is not compiled
with the highest optimization level available for the programming language
and the target architecture is not Memory Chad Blazing Safe, and is not
covered by the MCBS License. Memory space in the program must be optimized
to the highest degree possible, and all unused memory must be freed whenever
possible. It is the responsibility of the authors of the software to ensure
that the software is Memory Chad Blazing Safe rather than entirely relying on the 
compiler to optimize the software. Programs that are not Memory Chad Blazing Safe
are not covered by the MCBS License.

any and all damages caused by the use of software written under the MCBS
may not be claimed against the authors of the software, or the authors of
the MCBS License.

It is the responsibility of the authors of the software to ensure that their
software follows the terms of the MCBS License as it is updated.

All software written under the MCBS License must include a file called
"CONTRIBUTERS.md" in the root directory of the project, which lists all
contributors to the project, and their contributions to the project. If the project
becomes of such scale that it is no longer feasible to list their contributions,
the authors of the software may instead list their contributions as "Various
contributions to the project". It is required that with any updates to the software,
the authors of the software must update the "CONTRIBUTERS.md" file to reflect
the changes made to the software.

The authors of the MCBS License reserve the right to update the terms of the
MCBS License at any time, and it is the responsibility of the authors of the
software to ensure that their software follows the terms of the MCBS License
as it is updated.
