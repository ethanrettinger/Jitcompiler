# JITCOMPILER ðŸ”¥ ðŸš€

## What is JITCompiler?

The JITCompiler converts the raw binary data of an input file into the most
based file format, also known as .JIT. The JITCompiler is the most memory-chad
blazingly-safe program of the 22nd century. It is the most based program
ever written.

## How to use JITCompiler?

### Installation

To install JITCompiler, you need to have a C compiler installed. Then, you
can run `gcc jitcompile.c -o jitcompile` to compile the program.

### Usage

You can then run `./jitcompile <input file>` to compile the input file. The
output file will be named with the same name as the input file, but with the
`.jit` extension. You can not run .JIT files, but they do look swagger, dapper
and chad.

## How does JITCompiler work?

The JITCompiler works by reading the input file byte by byte, and then
converting the bits from 0s and 1s to jit and w0rld respectively

## Why is JITCompiler so based?

JITCompiler is so based because it is the most based program ever written.

## Why is JITCompiler so safe?
